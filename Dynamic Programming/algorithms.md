# Algorithms to Learn:

## Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

### The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

- The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
- The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
- And the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!

    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

## Optimization Problems:

- There are many problems in CS where you want to optimize some value:
  - Find the shortest path between two points
  - Find a line that best fits a set of points
  - Find the smallest set of objects that meet a criteria
  - Choose the fastest set of connections through a network
